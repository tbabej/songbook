\C{Fmaj7}{I} know that \C{G}{things} are \C{C}{broken}
\C{Fmaj7}{And} though there's too \C{G}{many} words left \C{C}{unsaid}
\C{Fmaj7}{You} say you \C{G}{have} \C{Am}{spoken}
Like the \C{Fmaj7}{coward} \C{G}{I am}, I hang my \C{C}{head}

And you lay careless your head on my chest
And don't even look at me looking my best
And all these things I can't describe
You would rather I didn't try

But \C{F}{please} \C{G}{don't} \C{Am}{cry}, \C{G}{you} \C{C}{liar}
Oh please, don't cry, you liar

They told me love was a fortress
And I had never put it to the test
And all the while I relied on this honesty
Well in love we are but amateurs at best

But please don't cry, you liar
Oh please, don't cry, you liar
Oh please, don't cry, you liar
Oh please, don't cry, you liar

You're leaving for your last kiss
And who in this world could ask me to resist
Your hands cold as they find my neck
All this love that I've found I detest
