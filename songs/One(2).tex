\C{Am}Is it getting \C{Dsus2}better
\C{Fmaj7}Or do you feel the \C{G}same
\C{Am}IWill it make it \C{Dsus2}easier on you
\C{Fmaj7}Now you got someone to \C{G}blame

You say
\C{C}One love
\C{Am}One life
\C{Fmaj7}When it's one need
\C{C}In the night
It's one love
We get to share it
It leaves you baby
If you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well it's too late
Tonight
To drag the past out
Into the light
We're one
But we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness
Have you come tor raise the dead
Havew you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head%

Did I ask too much
More than a lot
You gave me nothing
Now it's all I got
We're one
But we're not the same
We hurt each other
Then we do it again

You say
\C{C}Love is a temple
\C{Am}Love a higher law
\C{C}Love is a temple
\C{Am}Love the higher law
\C{C}You ask me to enter
\C{G}But then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on
\C{Fmaj7}To what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love
One blood
One life
You got to do what you should
One life
With each other
Sisters
Brothers

One life
But we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
\C{C Am}One
\C{Fmaj7 C}One
One
One
